# SPEM

SPEM (Stochastic Parameter Adjustment Module) is a Python script designed to demonstrate advanced techniques for adjusting learning rates in machine learning models.

## Features

- Adjust learning rates of model layers stochastically
- Monitor validation loss and adjust parameters based on convergence criteria
- Retry mechanism to find optimal learning rates

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- A machine learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)
